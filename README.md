# nmap-threatwatch-lab
Python-based Nmap lab for port scanning, service detection, and XML parsing. Built for Security+ learning, ThreatWatch integration, and portfolio impact.

This lab simulates a basic threat detection workflow using Nmap and Python. It scans a live HTTP service, parses the XML output, and extracts host status, port state, and service information. The goal is to build a reproducible, recruiter-ready cybersecurity project.

## üñ•Ô∏è Environment

This lab was built and tested using:

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- Python 3.11
- Nmap 7.95
- Kali Linux
- VMware Workstation

## üîß Lab Workflow

1. Start a Python HTTP server on port 8080
![HTTP Server](Start_python_server_8080.png)

2. Run an Nmap scan and save output to XML

Command Broken Down: nmap -sS -sV -O -p 8080 -oX scan8080.xml 127.0.0.1

nmap: Lanches the Nmap tool
-sV: Enables Service Verison Detection - identifies the software and version running on the port
-O: OS detection ‚Äì attempts to fingerprint the operating system
-p 8080: Port specification ‚Äì limits the scan to port 8080 (where your Python HTTP server is running)
-oX scan8080.xml: Output to XML ‚Äì saves the scan results in XML format for parsing
127.0.0.1 Target IP ‚Äì scans the localhost (your Kali VM itself)

üìÅ Why This Scan Is Useful
- Targets a live service you control (Python HTTP server)
- Produces structured XML output for your parser
- Simulates a real-world threat detection workflow
- Keeps the scope tight and reproducible for documentation

3. Parse the XML using Python to extract:

Command: cd ~/nmap-threatwatch-lab
üß† Why This Step Matters
‚Ä¢ 	Ensures the HTTP server serves content from your lab directory
‚Ä¢ 	Allows Python scripts to locate scan files and output folders
‚Ä¢ 	Keeps your workflow organized and reproducible

Command parse_nmap.py 

üß† What parse_nmap.py Actually Does
- Opens the Nmap XML file
It reads scan8080.xml (or whatever file is hardcoded or passed in) to access the scan results.
- Parses the XML structure
It uses a module like xml.etree.ElementTree to extract key data from the scan:
- Host status (e.g., up/down)
- Port number and protocol (e.g., 8080/tcp)
- Service name and version (e.g., http, Python HTTP server)
- Prints the results to the terminal

![Parser Output](Run_python_parser.png)
   - Host status
   - Port number and protocol
   - Service name and version
5. Display results in terminal
