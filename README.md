# nmap-threatwatch-lab
Python-based Nmap lab for port scanning, service detection, and XML parsing. Built for Security+ learning, ThreatWatch integration, and portfolio impact.

This lab simulates a basic threat detection workflow using Nmap and Python. It scans a live HTTP service, parses the XML output, and extracts host status, port state, and service information. The goal is to build a reproducible, recruiter-ready cybersecurity project.

## üñ•Ô∏è Environment

This lab was built and tested using:

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- Python 3.11
- Nmap 7.95
